EEC 134 Design of High Frequency System
======

EEC 134AB is a two-quarter senior design project course with a focus in high frequency system engineering. The course provides an opportunity to work on hands-on projects related to RF and wireless systems on the board level. The projects encompass multiple aspects of electrical engineering, including system design, antenna design, analog circuit design, embedded systems, and digital signal processing. The primary aim of the course is to prepare the students with a better understanding of engineering principles as well as practical engineering skills. 

The first project option we have implemented is a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system that can perform range, Doppler, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements. In the first quarter, the students build an FMCW radar system using breadboard and off-the-shelf connectorized RF components. In the second quarter the students focus on improving the system performance and gauge their success by a performance competition. In the future, other project options, such as software-defined radio (SDR), RFID systems, wireless sensors networks, and RF/microwave biomedical systems, will be explored.

This Github repo is used to distribute the EEC 134 lecture notes, lab manuals, and supplementary materials such as computer codes with registered EEC 134 students as well as anyone who is interested in the course materials. The public nature of this git repo means that that anyone can contribute to the development of the course materials.
